# 🎓 Machine Learning  – Regression & Classification (School Task)

This repository contains my school project for the Machine Learning course.  
The goal of this project is to implement and demonstrate:

- ✅ Linear Regression (for predicting continuous values)
- ✅ Logistic Regression (for binary classification)

Both algorithms are built:
- From scratch using **NumPy**
- Using **scikit-learn**
