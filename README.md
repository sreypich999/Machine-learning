# ðŸŽ“ Machine Learning  â€“ Regression & Classification (School Task)

This repository contains my school project for the Machine Learning course.  
The goal of this project is to implement and demonstrate:

- âœ… Linear Regression (for predicting continuous values)
- âœ… Logistic Regression (for binary classification)

Both algorithms are built:
- From scratch using **NumPy**
- Using **scikit-learn**

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

You can run these notebooks using **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

### ðŸ§ª Required Libraries

Make sure to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
